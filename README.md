# Brain-stroke-classification
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a machine learning project aimed at classifying brain strokes into ischemic and hemorrhagic types. Leveraging Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithms, we achieve high classification accuracy, providing a potential tool for aiding in the rapid diagnosis and treatment of strokes.

# Dataset
We utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which includes demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic variables. Key features include:

Age
Gender
Hypertension 
Heart disease 
Blood sugar levels 
Body Mass Index (BMI) 
Smoking status 
Work type 
Residence type

The target variable is the presence or absence of a stroke.
# Data Analysis

Age Distribution: Stroke incidence increases with age.
